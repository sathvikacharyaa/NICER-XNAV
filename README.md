# NICER Data Analysis Scripts

## About the Project
This repository contains all the Bash scripts used to generate and analyze data from NASA's NICER mission, focusing on high-energy X-ray pulsars. These scripts support data preparation, processing, and analysis tasks, making it easier to handle the extensive datasets produced by NICER.

## About the Mission
The Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) is a NASA mission onboard the International Space Station (ISS), specifically designed to study neutron stars and other high-energy astrophysical phenomena. NICER uses an array of X-ray detectors to capture precise timing and spectral data from X-ray sources, such as pulsars.  NICER observes X-ray pulsars, which emit highly regular pulses, to investigate potential navigation techniques for spacecraft, known as XNAV (X-ray navigation).
